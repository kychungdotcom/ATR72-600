InitialZoom = 0.65 ; [0.0, 512.0] Sets the initial zoom.
SmoothZoomTime = 2 ; [0.0, 30.0] The zoom time in seconds. By default, zooming in and out is �smoothed� by changing between old and new zoom levels over a small time period (5 seconds). This setting enables you to control this effect on a per-camera basis.
ZoomPanScalar = 1 ; [0.0, 100.0] Movement is scaled by dividing the ZoomPanScalar value by the zoom level.
ShowWeather = 1 ; Determines whether weather visuals are shown.
XyzAdjust = 1 ; Controls whether the camera responds to position change commands.
ShowLensFlare = 0 ; Determines whether lens flare effect can be shown (based on user setting).

PitchPanRate = 20 ; [0.0, 100.0] Controls the rate at which pitch is changed in degrees per second.
HeadingPanRate = 60 ; [0.0, 100.0] Controls the rate at which heading is changed in degrees per second.
InitialXyz = 1.9, 0.47, 2.11 ; All values are in meters, -500.0 to 500.0 (for each of the three). Camera XYZ position offset from the default location in meters.
InitialPbh = 179.4, 177.4, -40 ; All values are in degrees, -90 to 90.0 (pitch), -180 to 180.0 (bank and heading). Camera pitch, bank and heading orientation offset from the default in degrees. Note that positive pitches give a downward view. Positive headings are to the right.
NodesToHide = "" ; Allows to hide one or several node while showing this camera. This is useful to hide the Yoke in camera instrument, for example.
ClipMode = "0" ; Normal - Minimum - Spot - Tower.
BoundingBoxRadius = 0.1 ; Radius of the Camera in meters: you can use it as a bounding box.
